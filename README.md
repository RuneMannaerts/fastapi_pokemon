# fastapi_pokemon

## api theme:

so i made this api, with a pokemon theme in mind, i did this because of my love for pokemon games and how i would be playing pokemon games back in the day
i also used pokemon since i can quite easily find information wich would also be cool to use in future projects, the following picture is one about what the project can turn into and this is represented as a database:
